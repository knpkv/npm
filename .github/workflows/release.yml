# NPM Publishing Workflow
#
# This workflow automates the release process for packages in this monorepo.
# It uses changesets for version management and publishes to npm when ready.
#
# Security: Only runs for repository owner 'knpkv' with minimal required permissions
# Process: Creates release PRs → Merges PRs → Publishes to npm → Creates GitHub releases
