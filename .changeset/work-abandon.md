New approval-bound `work.abandon` job, which moves one Work goal to `abandoned`. The payload names the goal, its exact owner, a reason and the goal's expected head. The job hash covers every field, and the job always needs approval. `WorkService.abandon` clears the blocker and records a status activity naming the approved job. It refuses a goal with an active lane (`WorkGoalLaneActiveError`, naming the lane), a goal that has already finished (`WorkGoalTerminalError`), a stale head and a different owner. An exact replay returns the stored result. `runWorkAbandon` executes the job only with a persisted approval. The hub shows its fields, history and dashboard label, and `fleetctl submit HOST work.abandon PAYLOAD_JSON` submits it.
