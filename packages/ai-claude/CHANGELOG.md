# @knpkv/ai-claude

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#469](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/pull/469) [`0fd9544`](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/commit/0fd95449194e83de61109d432224acc043f57964) Thanks [@konopkov](https://github.com/konopkov)! - New `@knpkv/bounded-io` package: `limitBytes`, `collectBounded` and `collectBoundedText` read a stream under a byte budget and fail with `ByteLimitExceeded` on the chunk that crosses it. The AI CLI runners and the Herdr command, terminal, Tailscale and HTTP-body readers now use it instead of their own copies; their errors and limits are unchanged, and collection is linear instead of quadratic in the number of chunks.
- Updated dependencies [[`0fd9544`](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/commit/0fd95449194e83de61109d432224acc043f57964)]:

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#376](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/pull/376) [`379b029`](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/commit/379b02947180d50d4a40cf4b7723851aa68fc183) Thanks [@konopkov](https://github.com/konopkov)! - Add an optional reasoning effort override to the Claude model adapter. Omitting it preserves the CLI-configured default.

  Add optional bounded, cancellable visible activity callbacks. `onActivity` enables CLI partial-message output and reports the supplied request prompt, process milestones, visible assistant text, `StructuredOutput` JSON fragments and the final response, including for `generateObject`. System events, reasoning and other tool inputs are excluded; request events carry caller-supplied prompt content and stay within that prompt's authorization boundary. The stdout byte limit covers every event and the final result still passes schema validation. Without the callback, output remains buffered.

### Patch Changes

- [#376](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/pull/376) [`379b029`](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/commit/379b02947180d50d4a40cf4b7723851aa68fc183) Thanks [@konopkov](https://github.com/konopkov)! - Forward `USER` to the Claude CLI. Every call failed on macOS with `Not logged in · Please run
/login` even for a signed-in user, because the reviewed child environment withheld it. Login
  Keychain items are scoped to the account name, so the CLI could not find its own credentials. It
  carries no secret, being the account name the process already runs as.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#363](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/pull/363) [`316c383`](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/commit/316c3832c64ce159b7b18d9be3d58bf355c20b8a) Thanks [@konopkov](https://github.com/konopkov)! - Require Node.js 26 or newer and align the reproducible development, CI, release,
  benchmark, and package-validation toolchains with Node.js 26.

  Keep the CodeCommit CLI on the current Bun runtime, document that executable
  prerequisite, and require its Bun-hosted process boundaries in CI.

- [#370](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/pull/370) [`27d2ca1`](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/commit/27d2ca18b0c0b0f8a252d461c0aaf10eb92e9ffc) Thanks [@konopkov](https://github.com/konopkov)! - Enforce the complete anti-slop rule set with zero accepted diagnostics and update affected APIs and implementations to satisfy the required contracts.

### Patch Changes

- [#361](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/pull/361) [`676419e`](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/commit/676419e39c395dd4cfea6d9ffaee7d002a3f75e2) Thanks [@konopkov](https://github.com/konopkov)! - Update Effect and effect-qb, migrate schema-tagged errors to the current Effect API, and adopt the dialect-scoped SQLite function and type APIs introduced by effect-qb 0.22.

### Minor Changes

- [#126](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/pull/126) [`c770262`](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/commit/c7702624d7e388f6e9e3cd0dc93845e195737406) Thanks [@konopkov](https://github.com/konopkov)! - Add Effect AI-compatible language model providers for authenticated local Claude Code and Codex CLI installations. The Codex adapter also exposes a bounded, cancellation-safe stream of validated native JSONL events for progress and tool-call observability.
