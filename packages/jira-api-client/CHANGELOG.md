# @knpkv/jira-api-client

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#252](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/pull/252) [`6d510c9`](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/commit/6d510c9d3dab3e459db7fa1d25cd12f0e122699e) Thanks [@konopkov](https://github.com/konopkov)! - Update the generated Schema-backed Jira API client.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#125](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/pull/125) [`f820c19`](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/commit/f820c1906e00f2f2d17c2e7cc3921ba26522db43) Thanks [@konopkov](https://github.com/konopkov)! - Replace the legacy Atlassian `openapi-fetch` clients with generated,
  Schema-validated Effect clients. Jira and Confluence now provide direct Effect
  operations, injected `HttpClient` transports, deterministic local regeneration,
  structural upstream freshness checks, and scheduled tested update pull requests.

  The legacy `toEffect`, `FetchClientError`, raw `.client` operation surface, and
  type-only generated subpaths are removed.

Replace ad hoc object guards with Effect Predicate helpers and migrate retry schedules to the current Schedule API.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#111](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/pull/111) [`f7534ae`](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/commit/f7534ae868a010274f9c4a49ef95bd96e9a26506) Thanks [@github-actions](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)! - Update generated Jira API OpenAPI specs.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#71](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/pull/71) [`e3c3805`](https://github.com/knpkv/npm/commit/e3c3805ee527a6edb69ed91977c95c586b563ff9) Thanks [@konopkov](https://github.com/konopkov)! - Migrate the package workspace to Effect v4 beta.

  This updates runtime and peer dependencies to the Effect v4 beta module layout,
  adopts Effect platform/runtime services for Node process, HTTP, filesystem, and
  clock access, and refreshes package export metadata to point published type
  entries at emitted `dist/*.d.ts` declarations.

  CodeCommit packages now use Effect v4-compatible AWS and cache layers, including
  typed `distilled-aws` context services, shared cached-comment decoding, and
  schema-derived config defaults. Jira and Confluence OAuth callback servers bind
  the expected local callback port range again under the Effect v4 Node HTTP
  server layer.

  The retired Claude AI packages have been removed from the workspace.
