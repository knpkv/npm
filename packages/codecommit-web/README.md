# CodeCommit web pairing boundary

CodeCommit web owns an ephemeral, process-scoped owner session. Each bind rotates
the owner, CSRF, and bootstrap credentials; the bootstrap credential is valid for
60 seconds, single-use, and limited to five failed unauthenticated attempts. The
owner cookie is HttpOnly and SameSite=Strict. This intentionally differs from
Control Center's durable workspace session (12-hour idle and 30-day absolute
lifetimes). The policy is the shared single-operator Owner Session from
`@knpkv/browser-pairing/owner-session` (ADR-0008); CodeCommit web keeps its API
middleware, wire errors, `cc_owner` cookie name, and dev-proxy model.

Origin checks use the configured loopback authority captured at bind time. The
request `Host` header is not an authority source. Browser reads that Fetch
Metadata marks as cross-site, or as same-site/`none` without the bound Origin,
are refused; explicit clients without Fetch Metadata still need the owner
cookie.
